# Computerization-of-Civil-Supplies
The project focuses on computerization of Civil Supplies to overcome the problems of manual work. Civil Supplies Corporation is the major public sector which manages and distributes the essential commodities to all the citizens. In that system various products like Rice, sugar and kerosene are distributed using conventional ration shop system. Public Distribution System is a universal system to cover all the needy families by supplying the commodities at a price fixed by the Government. Some of the commodities distributed under Public Distribution System are Rice, kerosene, sugar etc. The problems in the conventional PDS system are illegal usage, overcrowd, poor quality of supplies etc.
To overcome these challenges computerization of civil supplies mechanism has been introduced by Civil Supplies Corporation. In this software we focus on creation of forms, master addition, master modification, master deletion and transaction forms and reports, customer and product wise reports (daily and monthly) and update the records in the database for accessing information. The computerization process software simplifies the issue of ration card. It provides hardware and software securities and it is portable and flexible for further extension.
